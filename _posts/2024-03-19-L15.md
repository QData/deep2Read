## Required Readings: 

### A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05232
  + The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), leading to remarkable advancements in text understanding and generation. Nevertheless, alongside these strides, LLMs exhibit a critical tendency to produce hallucinations, resulting in content that is inconsistent with real-world facts or user inputs. This phenomenon poses substantial challenges to their practical deployment and raises concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios, which attracts increasing attention to detect and mitigate these hallucinations. In this survey, we aim to provide a thorough and in-depth overview of recent advances in the field of LLM hallucinations. We begin with an innovative taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Additionally, representative approaches designed to mitigate hallucinations are introduced accordingly. Finally, we analyze the challenges that highlight the current limitations and formulate open questions, aiming to delineate pathways for future research on hallucinations in LLMs.

### LLMs as Factual Reasoners: Insights from Existing Benchmarks and Beyond
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14540
  + With the recent appearance of LLMs in practical settings, having methods that can effectively detect factual inconsistencies is crucial to reduce the propagation of misinformation and improve trust in model outputs. When testing on existing factual consistency benchmarks, we find that a few large language models (LLMs) perform competitively on classification benchmarks for factual inconsistency detection compared to traditional non-LLM methods. However, a closer analysis reveals that most LLMs fail on more complex formulations of the task and exposes issues with existing evaluation benchmarks, affecting evaluation precision. To address this, we propose a new protocol for inconsistency detection benchmark creation and implement it in a 10-domain benchmark called SummEdits. This new benchmark is 20 times more cost-effective per sample than previous benchmarks and highly reproducible, as we estimate inter-annotator agreement at about 0.9. Most LLMs struggle on SummEdits, with performance close to random chance. The best-performing model, GPT-4, is still 8\% below estimated human performance, highlighting the gaps in LLMs' ability to reason about facts and detect inconsistencies when they occur.


### Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation

+ Natural Language Generation (NLG) has improved exponentially in recent years thanks to the development of sequence-to-sequence deep learning technologies such as Transformer-based language models. This advancement has led to more fluent and coherent NLG, leading to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue generation and data-to-text generation. However, it is also apparent that deep learning based generation is prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system performance and fails to meet user expectations in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, many studies have been presented in measuring and mitigating hallucinated texts, but these have never been reviewed in a comprehensive manner before. In this survey, we thus provide a broad overview of the research progress and challenges in the hallucination problem in NLG. The survey is organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions; (2) an overview of task-specific research progress on hallucinations in the following downstream tasks, namely abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation, machine translation, and visual-language generation; and (3) hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). This survey serves to facilitate collaborative efforts among researchers in tackling the challenge of hallucinated texts in NLG.

## A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions<a id="a-survey-on-hallucination-in-large-language-models-principles-taxonomy-challenges-and-open-questions"></a>

  

### Brief introduction to LLM Hallucinations<a id="brief-introduction-to-llm-hallucinations"></a>

  

- The current definition of hallucinations characterizes them as generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the provided source content. 

  

- These hallucinations are further categorized into intrinsic hallucination and extrinsic hallucination types, depending on the contradiction with the source content.

  

- In LLMs, the scope of hallucination encompasses a broader and more comprehensive concept, primarily centering on factual errors. 

  

- In light of the evolution of the LLM era, there arises a need to adjust the existing hallucination taxonomy, enhancing its applicability and adaptability.

### Hallucination Detection and Benchmarks<a id="hallucination-detection-and-benchmarks"></a>

  

As LLMs have garnered substantial attention in recent times, distinguishing accurate and hallucinated content has become a pivotal concern these days. Two primary facets encompass the broad spectrum of hallucination mitigation: detection mechanisms and evaluation benchmarks.

  

Traditional metrics fall short in differentiating the nuanced discrepancies between plausible and hallucinated content, which highlights the necessity of more sophisticated detection methods.

  

**1. Factuality Hallucination Detection**

  

- **Retrieve External Facts** 

  

Comparing the model generated content against reliable knowledge sources. Here is an example of detecting factuality hallucination by retrieving external facts:

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_9.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

- **Uncertainty Estimation** 

  

Premise: the origin of LLM hallucinations is inherently tied to the model’s uncertainty.

  

Zero-resource settings. Categorized into 2 approaches:

  

1. LLM Internal States: operates under the assumption that one can access the model’s internal state

  

2. LLM Behavior: leveraging solely the model’s observable behaviors to infer its underlying uncertainty

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_10.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

**2. Faithfulness Hallucination Detection**

  

Focuses on ensuring the alignment of the generated content with the given context, sidestepping the potential pitfalls of extraneous or contradictory output.

  

- **Fact-based Metrics**: assesses faithfulness by measuring the overlap of facts between the generated content and the source content

  

- **Classifier-based Metrics**: utilizing trained classifiers to distinguish the level of entailment between the generated content and the source content

  

- **Question-Answering based Metrics**: employing question-answering systems to validate the consistency of information between the source content and the generated content

  

- **Uncertainty Estimation**: assesses faithfulness by measuring the model’s confidence in its generated outputs

  

- **Prompting-based Metrics**: induced to serve as evaluators, assessing the faithfulness of generated content through specific prompting strategies.

**3. Benchmarks**

  

- **Hallucination Evaluation Benchmarks**

  

Assess LLMs’ proclivity to produce hallucinations, with a particular   emphasis on identifying factual inaccuracies and measuring deviations from original contexts

  

- **Hallucination Detection Benchmarks**

  

Evaluate the performance of existing hallucination detection methods.

  

Primarily concentrated on task specific hallucinations, such as abstractive   summarization, data-to-text, and machine translation.

### Challenges and Open Questions<a id="challenges-and-open-questions"></a>

  

**Challenges in LLM Hallucination**

  

- **Hallucination in Long-form Text Generation**

  

Absence of manually annotated hallucination benchmarks in the domain of long-form text generation

  

- **Hallucination in Retrieval Augmented Generation**

  

Irrelevant evidence can be propagated into the generation phase, possibly tainting the output

  

- **Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models**

  

LVLMs sometimes mix or miss parts of the visual context, as well as fail to understand temporal or logical connections between them

  

**Open Questions in LLM Hallucination**

  

- **Can Self-Correct Mechanisms Help in Mitigating Reasoning Hallucinations?**

  

Occasionally exhibit unfaithful reasoning characterized by inconsistencies within the reasoning steps or conclusions that do not logically follow the reasoning chain.

  

- **Can We Accurately Capture LLM Knowledge Boundaries?**

  

LLMs still face challenges in recognizing their own knowledge boundaries. This shortfall leads to the occurrence of hallucinations, where LLMs confidently produce falsehoods without an awareness of their own knowledge limits.

  

- **How Can We Strike a Balance between Creativity and Factuality?** 

  

Hallucinations can sometimes offer valuable perspectives, particularly in creative endeavors such as storytelling, brainstorming, and generating solutions that transcend conventional thinking.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_16.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

LLMs are used to summarize documents across different domains. The summarizations must be accurate and factual. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_17.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

LLMs have some issues as factual reasoners. 

  

1. Not all LLMs can generate explanations that locate factual inaccuracies

  

2. Many mislabeled samples of factual inconsistencies are undetected by annotators. 

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_18.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

Laban et. al discusses LLMs as factual reasoners, propose a new protocol for creating inconsistency detection benchmarks, and release SummEdits, which applies their protocol across 10 domains. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_19.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_20.gif" width="100%" height="100%">Laban et. al test different LLMs on the FactCC dataset to find which LLMs are potentially factual reasoners. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_21.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

In-context learning and prompt engineering can optimize the desired output of LLMs.<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_22.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

The authors the factual accuracy of many LLMs and non-LLM models.<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_23.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

Their experiment yields a few interesting findings for the binary classification test:

  

- non-LLM outperforms the LLM.

  

- Few-shot will improve performance compared to zero-shot (not GPT4 and PaLM2).

  

- Generate-with-Evidence outperforms Chain-of-Thought.

  

- Persona-based improves GPT3.5-turbo performance.

  

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_24.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

They also found that the models are mostly accurate when detecting positive samples, but are very bad at detecting factual inconsistencies, particularly pronoun swaps. 

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_25.gif" width="100%" height="100%">Through manual analysis of the LLM outputs, they found that response explanations for challenging questions were either not given, irrelevant, or plausible but wrong. 

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_26.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

The authors also conducted a fine-grain analysis to evaluate each document sentence pair concerning individual error types while ignoring other types of errors. They recorded low precision but a high recall score, and they were not able to distinguish error types.

  

The authors also discuss the limitations of existing AggreFact and DialSumEval crowd-sourced benchmarks. The authors filtered out all models that did not achieve a balanced accuracy above 60% on FactCC and used a single Zero-Shot (ZS) prompt for all LLM models on these benchmarks.

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_27.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_28.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

The authors conclude there is low reliability for these crowd-sourced benchmarks. Further, the scale of these benchmarks limits their quality and interpretability. 

  

The authors propose a new protocol for inconsistency detection benchmark creation and implement it in a 10-domain benchmark called **SummEdits**. This new benchmark is 20 times more cost-effective per sample than previous benchmarks and highly reproducible, as they estimate inter-annotator agreement at about 0.9.

  

Based on the analysis of previous benchmarks, the authors set several design principles that can help create higher quality factual consistency benchmark:

  

- P1: Binary Classification Task: summary is either consistent or inconsistent

  

- P2: Focus on Factual Consistency: summary is flawless on attributes unrelated to consistency

  

- P3: Reproducibility: labels should be independent of annotator

  

- P4: Benchmark Diversity: inconsistencies should represent a wide range of errors in real textual domains

  

They introduce a protocol designed to create challenging benchmarks while ensuring the reproducibility of the labels. The protocol involves manually verifying the consistency of a small set of seed summaries and subsequently generating numerous edited versions of these summaries. 

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_29.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

More details are shown as follows

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_30.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

The procedure is visualized below

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_31.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

Some example samples produced by the protocol are presented as follows

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_32.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

The SummEdits benchmark was created by implementing the protocol in ten diverse textual domains, including the legal, dialogue, academic, financial, and sales domains. Specifically, it contains:

  

- News: Articles and summaries from Google News top events from February 2023

  

- Podcasts: 40 transcripts from Spotify dataset, automatic summaries

  

- BillSum: 40 US bills and their summaries

  

- SamSum: 40 dialogues and their summaries from a dialogue summarization dataset

  

- Shakespeare: 40 scenes, automatic summaries

  

- SciTLDR: 40 research paper abstracts and their summaries

  

- QMSum: 40 documents and summaries from query-based meeting summarization dataset

  

- ECTSum: 40 documents from financial earnings call dataset, automatic summaries

  

- Sales Call & Email: 40 fictional sales calls & emails generated along with summaries

  

For the statistics of SummEdits, the authors report that

  

- At least 20% of each domain’s samples were annotated by multiple annotators

  

- Cohen’s Kappa varied between 0.72-0.90 for the domains when considering the three labels, averaging 0.82

  

  - After removing ‘borderline’ samples, average Kappa rose to 0.92 -> high agreement

  

- Total cost: $3,000 for 150 hours of annotator work

  

  - Average domain cost is $300

  

- Using processes of other benchmarks would have had a 20x increase in cost

  

  - If each sample required 30 min of annotator time, as in the FRANK benchmark

  

The following table reports the average performance of specialized models, LLMs with a zero-shot prompt, an oracle version for the LLM in which it has access to additional information and an estimate of human performance computed on the subset of the benchmark which was plurally annotated.

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_33.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

From the table, we can see that

  

- Low performance overall - only GPT-4 comes within 10% of human performance

  

- Only 4 LLMs outperform non-LLM QAFactEval - most LLMs are not capable of reasoning about the consistency of facts out-of-the-box

  

- Specialized models performed best on News, probably because it was similar to their training data

  

- BillSum and Shakespeare are particularly challenging

  

- Oracle test: model is given document, seed, and edited summary

  

  - Large boost in performance, within 2% of human performance

  

  - Shows that high performance is indeed attainable

  

To gain more specific insights into the types of edits present in SUMMEDITS, the authors annotated each inconsistent sample in the benchmark with tags of edit types that lead to factual inconsistency, including the following four edit types:

  

- Entity modification

  

- Antonym Swap

  

- Hallucinated Fact Insertion

  

- Negation Insertion

  

  - SummEdits distribution: 78% of inconsistent summaries contain entity modification, 48% antonym swap, 22% hallucinated fact insertion, 18% negation insertion

  

    - Distribution influenced by the LLM used to produce the edits

  

Table 10 presents model performance across each of the edit types. Additionally, the authors grouped inconsistent summaries by the number of distinct edit types they contain (1 to 4) and computed model performance on each group, with results summarized in Table 11.

  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L15/images/intro_example_34.gif" width="100%" height="100%">

  

In conclusion, the authors of this paper

  

- simplified annotation process for improved reproducibility

  

- created SummEdits benchmark which spans 10 domains

  

  - Highly reproducible and more cost-effective than previous benchmarks

  

  - Challenging for most current LLMs

  

  - A valuable tool for evaluating LLMs’ ability to reason about facts and detect factual errors

  

- encouraged LLM developers to report their performance on the benchmark
