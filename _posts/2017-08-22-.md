+ Four types of deep neural networks (NN) that are out there today. This is bucketed in four broad categories.
  - General DL: Densely connected models like fully connected “FC” NN
  - Sequence Models: RNNs, GRUs
  - Image Models: CNNs
  - Unsupervised and Reinforcement learning: to extract patterns from data


 + Bias/variance trade-offs
