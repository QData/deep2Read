### Some Relevant Notes: 
On periodic domain, people always use Fourier basis, which eigenvectors of Laplace operator. On sphere, people use spherical harmonics, which also are eigenvectors of Laplace operator. In applied science, people decompose functions on a graph using eigenvectors of graph laplacian.
