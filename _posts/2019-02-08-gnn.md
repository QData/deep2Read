[^1]: <sub><sup> Some Relevant Notes from [URL](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/231987/why-decompose-a-function-with-eigenvectors-of-laplace-operator). On periodic domain, people always use Fourier basis, which eigenvectors of Laplace operator. On sphere, people use spherical harmonics, which also are eigenvectors of Laplace operator. In applied science, people decompose functions on a graph using eigenvectors of graph laplacian. Why are these basis preferred? The exponentials used in Fourier series are eigenvalues of shifts, and thus of any operator commuting with shifts, not just Laplacian. Similarly, spherical harmonics carry irreducible representations of ùëÜùëÇ(3) and so they are eigenfunctions of any rotationally invariant operator. If the underlying space has symmetries, it's no wonder that a basis respecting those symmetries has some nice properties. </sup></sub>
