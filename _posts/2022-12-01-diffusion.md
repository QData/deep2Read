| Stable diffusion | [ URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) | "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models"|
| DreamBooth: Fine Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Subject-Driven Generation | [ URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242) | " "personalization" of text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. ." |
| LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models | [  URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) | "propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times." |
