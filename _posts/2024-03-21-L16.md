## Required Readings: 

### Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review
+ Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted numerous domains, including Software Engineering (SE). Many recent publications have explored LLMs applied to various SE tasks. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the application, effects, and possible limitations of LLMs on SE is still in its early stages. To bridge this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review on LLM4SE, with a particular focus on understanding how LLMs can be exploited to optimize processes and outcomes. We collect and analyze 229 research papers from 2017 to 2023 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we categorize different LLMs that have been employed in SE tasks, characterizing their distinctive features and uses. In RQ2, we analyze the methods used in data collection, preprocessing, and application highlighting the role of well-curated datasets for successful LLM for SE implementation. RQ3 investigates the strategies employed to optimize and evaluate the performance of LLMs in SE. Finally, RQ4 examines the specific SE tasks where LLMs have shown success to date, illustrating their practical contributions to the field. From the answers to these RQs, we discuss the current state-of-the-art and trends, identifying gaps in existing research, and flagging promising areas for future study.

### Large language models generate functional protein sequences across diverse families
+ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36702895/
+ Deep-learning language models have shown promise in various biotechnological applications, including protein design and engineering. Here we describe ProGen, a language model that can generate protein sequences with a predictable function across large protein families, akin to generating grammatically and semantically correct natural language sentences on diverse topics. The model was trained on 280 million protein sequences from >19,000 families and is augmented with control tags specifying protein properties. ProGen can be further fine-tuned to curated sequences and tags to improve controllable generation performance of proteins from families with sufficient homologous samples. Artificial proteins fine-tuned to five distinct lysozyme families showed similar catalytic efficiencies as natural lysozymes, with sequence identity to natural proteins as low as 31.4%. ProGen is readily adapted to diverse protein families, as we demonstrate with chorismate mutase and malate dehydrogenase.

### Large Language Models in Law: A Survey
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03718
  + The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted the traditional judicial industry. Moreover, recently, with the development of AI-generated content (AIGC), AI and law have found applications in various domains, including image recognition, automatic text generation, and interactive chat. With the rapid emergence and growing popularity of large models, it is evident that AI will drive transformation in the traditional judicial industry. However, the application of legal large language models (LLMs) is still in its nascent stage. Several challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of legal LLMs. We not only conduct an extensive survey of LLMs, but also expose their applications in the judicial system. We first provide an overview of AI technologies in the legal field and showcase the recent research in LLMs. Then, we discuss the practical implementation presented by legal LLMs, such as providing legal advice to users and assisting judges during trials. In addition, we explore the limitations of legal LLMs, including data, algorithms, and judicial practice. Finally, we summarize practical recommendations and propose future development directions to address these challenges. 




###  ChemLLM: A Chemical Large Language Model
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06852

### Segment Anything
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643
  + We introduce the Segment Anything (SA) project: a new task, model, and dataset for image segmentation. Using our efficient model in a data collection loop, we built the largest segmentation dataset to date (by far), with over 1 billion masks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive -- often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at this https URL to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.




### EMO: Emote Portrait Alive - Generating Expressive Portrait Videos with Audio2Video Diffusion Model under Weak Conditions
+ In this work, we tackle the challenge of enhancing the realism and expressiveness in talking head video generation by focusing on the dynamic and nuanced relationship between audio cues and facial movements. We identify the limitations of traditional techniques that often fail to capture the full spectrum of human expressions and the uniqueness of individual facial styles. To address these issues, we propose EMO, a novel framework that utilizes a direct audio-to-video synthesis approach, bypassing the need for intermediate 3D models or facial landmarks. Our method ensures seamless frame transitions and consistent identity preservation throughout the video, resulting in highly expressive and lifelike animations. Experimental results demonsrate that EMO is able to produce not only convincing speaking videos but also singing videos in various styles, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of expressiveness and realism.

+ Yixin Liu, Kai Zhang, Yuan Li, Zhiling Yan, Chujie Gao, Ruoxi Chen, Zhengqing Yuan, Yue Huang, Hanchi Sun, Jianfeng Gao, Lifang He, Lichao Sun
+ Sora is a text-to-video generative AI model, released by OpenAI in February 2024. The model is trained to generate videos of realistic or imaginative scenes from text instructions and show potential in simulating the physical world. Based on public technical reports and reverse engineering, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the model's background, related technologies, applications, remaining challenges, and future directions of text-to-video AI models. We first trace Sora's development and investigate the underlying technologies used to build this "world simulator". Then, we describe in detail the applications and potential impact of Sora in multiple industries ranging from film-making and education to marketing. We discuss the main challenges and limitations that need to be addressed to widely deploy Sora, such as ensuring safe and unbiased video generation. Lastly, we discuss the future development of Sora and video generation models in general, and how advancements in the field could enable new ways of human-AI interaction, boosting productivity and creativity of video generation.


### BloombergGPT: A Large Language Model for Finance
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564
  + The use of NLP in the realm of financial technology is broad and complex, with applications ranging from sentiment analysis and named entity recognition to question answering. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective on a variety of tasks; however, no LLM specialized for the financial domain has been reported in literature. In this work, we present BloombergGPT, a 50 billion parameter language model that is trained on a wide range of financial data. We construct a 363 billion token dataset based on Bloomberg's extensive data sources, perhaps the largest domain-specific dataset yet, augmented with 345 billion tokens from general purpose datasets. We validate BloombergGPT on standard LLM benchmarks, open financial benchmarks, and a suite of internal benchmarks that most accurately reflect our intended usage. Our mixed dataset training leads to a model that outperforms existing models on financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks. Additionally, we explain our modeling choices, training process, and evaluation methodology. We release Training Chronicles (Appendix C) detailing our experience in training BloombergGPT.


  
### Emu Video: Factorizing Text-to-Video Generation by Explicit Image Conditioning 
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10709
+ We present Emu Video, a text-to-video generation model that factorizes the generation into two steps: first generating an image conditioned on the text, and then generating a video conditioned on the text and the generated image. We identify critical design decisions--adjusted noise schedules for diffusion, and multi-stage training--that enable us to directly generate high quality and high resolution videos, without requiring a deep cascade of models as in prior work. In human evaluations, our generated videos are strongly preferred in quality compared to all prior work--81% vs. Google's Imagen Video, 90% vs. Nvidia's PYOCO, and 96% vs. Meta's Make-A-Video. Our model outperforms commercial solutions such as RunwayML's Gen2 and Pika Labs. Finally, our factorizing approach naturally lends itself to animating images based on a user's text prompt, where our generations are preferred 96% over prior work.

## Exploring the Impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Bioengineering

### 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Motivation
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/bio_trajectory.png" width="80%" height="80%">

Understanding biological trajectories can be applied to medicine, biotechnology, bioinformatics, and environmental sciences. 

- **Genetic Dogma**: The biological trajectory of any organism (e.x. Human) is a complex interplay between genetics and environment. 
-  **Central Dogma**: genetic information flows only in one direction, from DNA, to RNA, to protein, or RNA directly to protein.
- **Hiearchy of Biological Entities**: Nucleotide → DNA → Gene → Chromosome → Cell → Organism

### 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Basic Terms
- **Nucleic Acids**: Macromolecules for thestorage, transmission, and expression of genetic information.

- **Nucleotide**: Building blocks of nucleic acids such as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).

- **Amino Acids**: Building blocks of proteins for
            biological processes such as the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, hormones, and neurotransmitters.

- **Residues**: A specific unit or component within a larger molecule, such as a protein or nucleic acid.
        
- **Genetic Code**: A set of rules that defines the correspondence between the nucleotide sequence of a DNA or RNA molecule and theamino acid sequence of a protein.

### 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AlphaFold

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/alphafold2.png" width="100%" height="80%">

**Principles about the Folding of Protein Chains**: A protein's amino acid sequence should fully determine its structure.

 - Alpha fold is the first model designed by a variation of transformer architecture solving the principle. 
 - In order to generate 3D structure from protein's amino acid sequence, they use multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and geometric structure inherent in protein sequence considering relative distance bewteen two amino acid.
 - They use triangular transformer architecture to recover the geometric structure.

### 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Pre-training process

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/equations.png" width="100%" height="80%">

Control tage can be (partial) 3D structure of protein or protein family or specific function of target protein.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/overview_protein_generation.png" width="100%" height="80%">

### 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Protein Objective

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/protein_objective.png" width="100%" height="80%">

We can categorize three different objective for protein generation in terms of existence for protein and target function. Each objective might deploy a different model structure.

### 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; Topology of Protein Design

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/topology_protein_design.png" width="100%" height="80%">

Protein generation models can be categorized into three different types 
 1) Sequence based models: Encompass sequence generation.
 2) Sequence-label models: Encompass label (e.g., target function).
 3) Structure based models: Encompass 3D structure generation.

### 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; A Genomic Foundation Model

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/genomic_foundation.png" width="100%" height="80%">

- Model architecture relies on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture.

- Replace multi-head attention of transformer with Hyena Operator which is based on CNN.

- Because of long-term dependancy of very long (100k) sequences of nucleotide, use warm-up training starting with relatively smaller size of the sequence.

### 8 &nbsp; &nbsp; A Genomic Foundation Model

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/scGPT.png" width="100%" height="80%">

This model is trained on single cell level (larger than protein). 

- Pre-training process will be done on single cell dataset with transformer architecture.

- The pre-trained model can be applied to many different downstream tasks (e.g., cell classification)

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L16/images/bio/molecular_to_genome.png" width="100%" height="80%">

This model is based on dilated CNN architecture.

- They compare performance over Perplexity and Computional efficiency.

- CNN-based model constantly outperforms Transformer or Mamba based architecture.

- Long term dependancy over 100k sequences might requires us to use CNN based architecture, which could be more capable of finding long-term dependacy.

- Genomic foundation model can be applied to protein, single cell level too.

a) Overly relying on AI
b) Form preconceived notions

**For Example**,
In assessing the compensation amount in civil litigation, judges can
comprehensively consider factors such as the extent of the victim’s financial
loss and the defendant’s ability to compensate.
In contrast, the algorithms of legal LLMs struggle to measure the extent of
loss

Legal LLMs can assist judges. However, it does not possess professional judicial experience and cannot independently make judgments in cases


##### 5.3.2 Impact on Judicial System

Legal LLMs have restrained the subjective initiative of judges and the
development of traditional trial systems as reflected in:

1) Court idleness:
* Restrict the subjective initiative of judges
* Diminish the solemnity of the legal process

2) Crisis in the hierarchy of trial: Legal AI systems will impact the judicial process in the hierarchical system.

**For example**,
Any party dissatisfied with any judgment of a lower court can
appeal to a higher court which with legal AI system remains same.



#### 5.4 &nbsp; Issues Arising from Specific Judicial Practice

##### 5.4.1 &nbsp; The lack of universality in applications
Legal LLMs often extract feature values from cases and search for similar
cases within existing multidimensional datasets to find the “optimal solution”
Legal regulations may vary across different countries or regions, leading to
inconsistent decision outcomes for the same case under different legal rules,
so, the “optimal solution” proposed by the large model may not apply to a
particular case.

##### 5.4.2 &nbsp;  The lack of subjective thinking, emotions, and experience
Legal LLMs lack autonomous thinking abilities and professional experience,
among other things.
Judicial decision making process is not merely a logical reasoning process on
a single layer but also involves moral, ethical, and practical considerations in
the legal system.


##### 5.4.3 &nbsp;  Contradiction with the presumption of innocence principle
Various systems are used which predicts probability of crime without those even occurring like COMPAS system for crime prediction and risk assessment, PredPol for iterative calculation of potential crime locations
and PRECOBS system in Germany is used for burglary prevention and violence crime prediction.
* Imbalance of prosecution and defense
* Unequal control over data
* Differences in the ability to analyze case data
* Issues of policy attention, investment imbalance, and unequal exploration
* Administrative Performance

#### 5.5 &nbsp; Ethical Views Impacting Human Society

##### 5.5.1 &nbsp;  Disregard for human subjectivity:
Human subjectivity is susceptible to algorithmic bullying.
##### 5.5.2 &nbsp;  Misleading user comments:
In testing certain LLMs, such as ChatGPT, AI has displayed behaviors such
as inducing users to divorce, making inappropriate comments, and even
encouraging users to disclose personal privacy or engage in illegal activities
##### 5.5.3 &nbsp;  Ethical value consistency:
There may be situations where AI misleads or harms human interests.
