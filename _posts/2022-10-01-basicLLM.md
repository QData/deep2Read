| Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models | [ URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682) | "an ability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models. Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models."|
| Language Models are Few-Shot Learners | [ URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) | "GPT-3, 175B autoregerssive LLM;  show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches."|
| On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models | [  URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)   | " a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations)." |
