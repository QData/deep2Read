> ####  deepCRISPR: optimized CRISPR guide RNA design by deep learning / Genome Biology 2018
>> A major challenge for effective application of CRISPR systems is to accurately predict the single guide RNA (sgRNA) on-target knockout efficacy and off-target profile, which would facilitate the optimized design of sgRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. Here we present DeepCRISPR, a comprehensive computational platform to unify sgRNA on-target and off-target site prediction into one framework with deep learning, surpassing available state-of-the-art in silico tools. In addition, DeepCRISPR fully automates the identification of sequence and epigenetic features that may affect sgRNA knockout efficacy in a data-driven manner. DeepCRISPR is available at http://www.deepcrispr.net/.
