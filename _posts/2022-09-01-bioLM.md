| Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic level protein structure with a language model | [URL](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902v2) | "show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters,..."|
| DiffDock: Diffusion Steps, Twists, and Turns for Molecular Docking  | [ URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01776) | "Recent deep learning methods that treat docking as a regression problem have decreased runtime compared to traditional search-based methods but have yet to offer substantial improvements in accuracy. We instead frame molecular docking as a generative modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space." |
