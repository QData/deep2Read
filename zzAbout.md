## About this website:

+ As a group, we need to improve our knowledge of the fast-growing field of deep learning
+ To educate new members with basic tutorials, and to help existing members understand advanced topics.
+ This website includes a (growing) list of tutorials and papers we survey for such a purpose.
+ We hope this website is helpful to people who share similar research interests or are interested with learning advanced topics about deep learning.
+ Please feel free to email me (yanjun@virginia.edu), if you have related comments, questions or recommendations.
+ BTW: The covered tutorials and papers are by no means an exhaustive list, but are topics which we have learned or plan to learn in our reading group.
