## About this website:

+ I build this GitHub Page website to educate myself (+my collaborators) to catch up with the fast growing AI literature and Deep learning Tech.
+ This website includes a (growing) list of tech materials I read for the above purpose.
+ I hope this website helps people who share similar interests or want to learn similar topics.
+ Please feel free to email me (yanjun.research@gmail.com), if you have  comments, questions or recommendations.

## Claim 
+ BTW: The covered tutorials and papers are by no means an exhaustive list, but are topics which we have learned or plan to learn in our reading group.

## History

+ This website was started from the seminar course "Advances in Deep Learning" I taught at UVA in Fall 2017. Later I expand the content with  team reaing group materials, multiple graduate seminiar courses I taught since 2017, plus my own reading notes.
