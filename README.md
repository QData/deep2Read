## About this website:

+ As a group, we need to improve our knowledge of the fast-growing field of deep learning
+ To educate new members with basic tutorials, and to help existing members understand advanced topics.
+ This website includes a (growing) list of tutorials and papers we survey for such a purpose.
+ We hope this website is helpful to people who share similar research interests or are interested with learning advanced topics about deep learning.
+ Please feel free to email me (yanjun@virginia.edu), if you have related comments, questions or recommendations.

## Claim 
+ BTW: The covered tutorials and papers are by no means an exhaustive list, but are topics which we have learned or plan to learn in our reading group.

## History

+ This website was started from the seminar course "Advances in Deep Learning" I taught at UVA in Fall 2017. Later I expand the content with my team reaing group and another course I taught in Spring 2019. 

+ The materials aim to offer opportunities for students to have in-depth understanding and hands-on experience of advances in deep learning.
